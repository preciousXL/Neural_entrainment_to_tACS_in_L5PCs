# Neural entrainment to tACS in L5 PCs

Code associated with paper: "Huang XL, Wei XL, Wang J, Yi GS. Multi-scale model of neural entrainment by transcranial alternating current stimulation in realistic cortical anatomy. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 2025."

## 1. Reproduction of paper figures:
Run `figure*.ipynb` files to plot the figures in the main text, the plot data are stored in directory `data_paper/`

## 2. Simulations
`simnibs_ernie`: caculation of electric field based FEM, using SimNIBS.
`neuron_others`: neuronal response simulations for L5 PCs (from clone 1 to clone 5), using NEURON.
